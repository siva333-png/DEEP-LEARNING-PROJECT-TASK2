Task Description :â€“
This deep_learning_deliverable.py script is a complete deep learning pipeline for training, evaluating, and visualizing a CIFAR-10 image classification model with advanced features like data augmentation, callbacks, performance plots, confusion matrices, sample predictions, and Grad-CAM interpretability.

Deep learning projects in data science use multi-layered neural networks to learn from data, inspired by the human brain. They are used for tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, predictive analytics, and more. 
Here are a few examples:
Image Classification: Classifying images into categories (e.g., Cat vs. Dog Classification) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing text to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
Text Generation: Generating new text, such as stories or summaries, using RNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
Recommendation Systems: Recommending items (e.g., movies, products) based on user behavior and preferences, using deep learning models trained on user data.
Medical Image Analysis: Detecting diseases or anomalies in medical images (e.g., Lung Cancer Detection from CT scans).
Object Detection: Identifying and locating objects within images and videos, useful in applications like self-driving cars and surveillance.
